Emanuel Romanian Church of God app

I have taken on a personal endeavour to create a fairly simple, yet unexpectedly complex, application for my church.
This is the probably the fifth or sixth iteration on the design and layout of the whole app. Credits to Jason C. and Andrew V. for
their continued support and ideas on how to design it.


Seeing as I have never built an application on my own, with my 3+ months of Java experience and some free time, I think it's turning out
much better than initially expected.


So far, my biggest struggles have been finding professional, or at least non-mediocre, assets and resources to use in design.
Designing is hard. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.


From the getgo I felt like I bit off way more than I can chew but part of being a developer (which I cannot say I am yet) is being able
to take a really big and complex problem, and break it down into as little, bite size pieces, as possible.
